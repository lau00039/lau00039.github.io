Challenges:

In my previous projects, I have only done nav bar across the screen for mobile/ tablet but never a hamburger menu. Since I have designed a hamburger menu in my XD design, I decided to take the challenge and create one that match closely with my mockup. I did not use Bootstrap because I have already done that in my Bootstrap assignment. I went on w3schools.com and looked for how to make a nav bar hamburger menu and tried out each property and change the value to acheive the look I wanted.

I was facing challenges from going from mobile home screen to tablet home screen because they have a different layout, so i had go into my html and did some changes.

Took me many tries to figure out how to add an overlay background on top of the background image and have the all contents above it. I needed to add a position value and set a z-index: 1 property.



    /* .grid-container.container-content {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
        grid-template-areas: 
            "intro intro"
            "hire resume";
    }

    .grid-container.container-intro {
        grid-area: intro;}
    
    .grid-container div.hire{
        grid-area: hire;
    }

    .grid-container div.resume{
        grid-area: resume;
    } */
