Challenges I faced while doing my Web Portfolio Final Project:

While I was working my best to match up with the mockup, I realized some small details are only noticeable during the development process. For instance, in my mockup, I have a portfolio page that displays all my works. It looks fine in the XD file, but as I was coding it, I felt like the page was too crowded and inconsistent with my other pages. Hence, I decided to have a Portfolio landing page with two buttons to navigate to each specific subject. The Photography page is good because all photos have the same dimensions, however; my branding designs all have different shapes and dimensions, and I decided to link it to a pdf file, so that it can look more clean.

In my previous projects, I have only done a nav bar across the screen for mobile/ tablet but never a hamburger menu. Since I have designed a hamburger menu in my XD design, I decided to take the challenge and create one that matches closely with my mockup. I did not use Bootstrap because I have already done that in my Bootstrap assignment. I went on w3schools.com and looked for how to make a navbar hamburger menu and tried out each property and change the value to achieve the look I wanted.

Going from mobile home screen to tablet home screen was another challenge for me because I set a different layout for the mobile and tablet screen, so as I coded, I had to go into the HTML and made changes.

Took me many tries to figure out how to add an overlay background on top of the background image and have the all contents above it. I needed to add a position value and set a z-index: 1 property. I applied that to my Home and Portfolio page. For the About and Contact page, I brought the image in Photoshop, put an overlay on top of it, and sent it back to Visual Studio Code.

When I tried to apply a border-radius on my About page image, it became an oval shape, if I tried to set an equal width and height to it, it stretched and became distorted. So I had to drop my original image to https://croppola.com/ and make it a square image so that I can get a perfect circle image from it.

I have learned so many things during this Final Project: project management, organizational skills, and how to create proficient UX/ UI designs in the future. I understand more about sizing and how to make it accessible to all different users.
