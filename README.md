Challenges:

In my previous projects, I have only done nav bar across the screen for mobile/ tablet but never a hamburger menu. Since I have designed a hamburger menu in my XD design, I decided to take the challenge and create one that match closely with my mockup. I did not use Bootstrap because I have already done that in my Bootstrap assignment. I went on w3schools.com and looked for how to make a nav bar hamburger menu and tried out each property and change the value to acheive the look I wanted.
